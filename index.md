## Conclave

[Conclave](https://github.com/multiparty/conclave) is a query compiler for relational MPC workflows. 
Conclave automatically transforms SQL-like queries into a series of local and secure computations such 
that as little secure computation is done as possible. In doing so, Conclave is able to, in certain cases, 
scale to realistically-sized datasets while still delivering the security guarantees of MPC.
